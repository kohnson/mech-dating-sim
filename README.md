Info
----
> When's it coming out?<br/>
When grill finishes it. Be patient.<br/>
> How will the powershell version work?<br/>
It's a text-based story that runs in your terminal.<br/>
> The default powershell colours are ugly.<br/>
Right-click the title bar, select "Properties", and change them to your liking.
Do the same thing in the "Defaults" section.

How to Get It
-------------
### Online Version
You can play it in your browser [here](TODO: insert link to github site)
### PowerShell Version
Run this command:
`$(iwr (add link to install.ps1 script)).Content >> .\install.ps1 ; .\install.ps1`
You can't use the `-OutFile` parameter because the pc will recognize the file as being from the internet and refuse to run it.
